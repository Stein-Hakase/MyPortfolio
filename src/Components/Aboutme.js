                <p className="about-desc">My name is Fakhreddine Hariz from Tunisia and living in Russia.
I have a degree in computer science since 2013.I am very passionate about programming, for many reasons, I did not find a job in an IT company after my diploma and one of the reasons our country was in revolution at that time ... Anyway, I started to try other ways to make different careers but I kept my passion for programming inside and I always tried to be updated with new technologies, hoping that one day I could come back and do what I really love as a job!
Now the opportunity shows up and here I am doing my portfolio as a front-end developer. Now i feel like a beast  about learning i spend more than 7 hours in a day just watching tutorials and learning . I want to make up for the time spent !</p>
